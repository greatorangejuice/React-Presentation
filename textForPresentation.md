# Presentation ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js.svg?branch=master)

Hello! I am Pavel and today I want to speak with you about ReactJS. 

## Let's do it! 
###Part One
ReactJS - it's a simple library by Facebook. But so many people saying that it's Framework and we can agree with it. 
Main React goal - it's simply UI bulding.
The most popular thing, where we can use React - it's SPA or single page applications. 

#####WHAT MAKES REACTJS STAND OUT?

ReactJS - it's component-based library. Thanks for react-components you can build incapsulated blocks with their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
React has two variables of components: statefull and stateless.

* Simple component
That just simple component without own state. U can use simple component for render static HTML.

At first ReactJS it's JSX - special syntax,  which unites HTML and JS. 


And Virtual DOM
And CompOnents
###Part two
You can ask me: "Hey, you! Why React - it's cool? Show something us."

Hmmm... Okey. Let's imagine, this house - it's our Application, which we build for one hour for example. And what we can do with this?

Хм, хм, хм
О, ачивка!

Aaaaaand.... Cool.

And just now we added React to our own project. It's simply! 
You can add React to just one page, our for all project. 

And it's all without... [SHOW PICTURE]
