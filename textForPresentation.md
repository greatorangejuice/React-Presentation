Hello! I am Pavel and today I want to speak with you about ReactJS. 

### Let's do it! 
ReactJS - it's a simple library. But so many people saying that it's Framework and we can agree with it. 
The most popular thing, where we can use React - it's SPA or single page applications. I hope that you know, what is it. If no... So, it's application, which u can use without reloading page. It's really cool.

You can ask me: "Hey, you! Why React - it's cool? Show something us."
