# Presentation ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js.svg?branch=master)

Hello! I am Pavel and today I want to speak with you about ReactJS.

## Let's do it!
###Part One
ReactJS - it's a simple library by Facebook. But so many people saying that it's Framework and we can agree with it. 
Main React goal - it's simply UI bulding.
The most popular thing, where we can use React - it's SPA or single page applications.

#####WHAT MAKES REACTJS STAND OUT?
* JSX

At first ReactJS it's JSX - special syntax,  which unites XML and JS.
But you can use HTML + JavaScript.

ReactJS - it's component-based library. Thanks for react-components you can build incapsulated blocks with their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
#####React has two variables of components: statefull and stateless.

* Simple component

That just simple component without own state. U can use simple component for render static HTML. But stateless component - it's not just static HTML. You can use this component and for dynamic HTML with props. About props I will say later.
#####So, when you will use simple component?
    When you just need to present the props
    When you don’t need a state, or any internal variables
    When creating element does not need to be interactive
    When you want reusable code

* Statefull component

That component has state and thanks state u can build dynamic HTML.
And your simple component can inherite state thanks with props.
#####When would you use a stateful component?
    When building element that accepts user input
    ..or element that is interactive on page
    When dependent on state for rendering, such as, fetching data before rendering
    When dependent on any data that cannot be passed down as props

* ReactDOM

ReactJS has own virtualDOM. Thanks this your ReactJs applications are crossbrawsers(переписать). And thanks this applications can be work faster.
The main concept of virtual DOM - it is new render just changed some childes. Not ALL DOM. 

* Props and State

I said about you about state and props. 

And Virtual DOM
And CompOnents
###Part two
You can ask me: "Hey, you! Why React - it's cool? Show something us."

* House slide

Hmmm... Okey. Let's imagine, this house - it's our Application, which we build for one hour for example. And what we can do with this?

* House slide [2]

Let's create magic!
Хм, хм, хм
О, ачивка!

* House slide [3]

Aaaaaand.... Cool.

* House slide [4]

And just now we added React to our own project. It's simply! 
You can add React to just one page, our for all project. 

And it's all without... [SHOW PICTURE]
